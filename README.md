Gif API
=====

The Gif API is a pubic API hosted on Github. It consists of the gifs and a json file describing the gifs.

It is open for anyone to submit new gifs.  

## Adding Gifs

To add a gif to the API: 
* Fork this repo
* Add the gif
* Add the relevant information to the json file, making sure to increment the id accordingly.
* If you don't want to download all of the gifs in order to add a new one, you can create a gist with the relevant json information and the gif or a link to the gif. Then just start an issue with a link to the gif.
